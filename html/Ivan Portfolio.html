            <h1>Automated Maze Solving Bot</h1>
            <h2>Meshmerize Competition IIT Bombay</h2>
            <p>Created an autonomous maze solver line following bot which was coded in C to first run through the maze by detecting the white stripes and memorizing the complete path. Each intersection was stored in the order of their appearance. In the second run bot calculated the optimal path and completed the maze as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>Preferences of the user are taken at every step in his/her priority order which will lead to the products that could be recommended, at the end user will receive top priority products.
            Final priorites of the products are decided by assiging weights to the options selected by the user and then its list is sorted to recommend the best product possible. The code was designed to maximize the the scalablity and alter the weights of each selection very easily.</p>
